# DD2423-Image-Analysis-and-Computer-Vision
Completed assignments for course DD2423. Course information can be found at https://www.kth.se/student/kurser/kurs/DD2423?l=en. 

When it comes to image analysis, the course included: signal theoretical methods, filtering, image enhancement, image reconstruction, segmentation, classification, representation.

As for computer vision, it included: multiscale representation, detection of edges and other distinctive features. Stereo and multi-camera systems. Object recognition, morphology.


## Assignment 1.


The first assignment covers frequency analysis using the Fourier transform (1d as well as 2d) as well as designing and using a smoothing filter for Gaussian convolutions. Various filters were applied to different kinds of noise and the results were analyzed. The effects of smoothing on different image resolutions generated by subsampling were studied.

### Sample results.
